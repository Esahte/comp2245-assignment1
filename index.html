            <p>I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of the West Indies. I am from Cameroon, and I am
                21 years old. I am currently in my 3rd year of study, and I am enjoying it so far. I am looking forward to
                learning more about web development and I hope to be able to use the skills I learn in this course to build
                a website for my family business.</p>
